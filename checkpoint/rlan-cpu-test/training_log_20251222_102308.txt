AUGMENTATION CONFIGURATION
============================================================
  1. Dihedral (D4 group): ENABLED
     - 8 transforms: identity, rot90, rot180, rot270, flipLR, flipUD, transpose, anti-transpose
  2. Color Permutation:   ENABLED
     - 9! = 362,880 permutations (colors 1-9 shuffled, 0 fixed)
     - Probability: 100% (CRITICAL: 100% breaks color identity learning!)
  3. Translational:       ENABLED
     - Random offset within 30x30 canvas (~100 positions)

  Total Diversity: 8 x 362,880 x ~100 = ~290,304,000 unique per task
  Mode: On-the-fly (EACH sample is NEW random augmentation)
  Advantage: Infinite diversity vs TRM's fixed 1000 samples
