# RLAN Core Ablation Configuration
# ==================================
# Tests the CORE NOVELTY of RLAN: DSC + MSRE (spatial anchoring + relative coords)
# 
# ENABLED MODULES:
#   - ContextEncoder: 4.2M params (REQUIRED - provides task signal)
#   - DSC: 266K params (CORE - find spatial anchors)
#   - MSRE: 109K params (CORE - relative coordinate encoding)
#   - Encoder + Solver: Core pipeline
#
# DISABLED MODULES:
#   - LCR: 403K params → 0 (no soft counting)
#   - SPH: 232K params → 0 (no symbolic predicates)
#
# This tests the hypothesis:
#   "Can RLAN solve tasks by reasoning in relative coordinates 
#    anchored to dynamically discovered features?"
#
# If this config works better than RLAN-Full, it proves the core novelty
# and suggests LCR/SPH are not essential.
#
# ==================================
# DEBUGGING CHECKPOINTS (what to look for in training logs)
# ==================================
# 
# EPOCH 5-10 (Early training):
#   - Grad Norms: DSC should be > 0.01 (gradients flowing)
#   - Per-Clue Entropy: Should be < 5.0 (attention starting to focus)
#   - Attention max: Should be > 0.01 (not uniform)
#   - Task Loss: Should be dropping from ~2.4
#
# EPOCH 25 (DSC should be contributing):
#   - Per-Clue Entropy: Should be < 4.0 (focused attention)
#   - Centroid Spread: Should be > 3.0 (clues spreading out)
#   - Per-Step Loss: Later steps should be lower than earlier steps
#   - Non-BG Accuracy: Should be > 0.1 (not just predicting black)
#
# EPOCH 50 (DSC fully engaged):
#   - Per-Clue Entropy: Should be < 3.0 (sharp attention)
#   - Attention max: Should be > 0.1 (very focused)
#   - Task Accuracy: Should be > 0.0 (some tasks solved)
#   - Deep Supervision Loss: Should be > 0.0 (contributing to learning)
#
# RED FLAGS (problems requiring intervention):
#   - DSC grad norm < 0.001 → gradients not reaching DSC
#   - Entropy > 5.0 after epoch 25 → attention still diffuse
#   - Centroid spread < 2.0 → all clues attending to same location
#   - Non-BG Accuracy decreasing → background collapse
#   - Per-Step Loss not improving → solver not refining

  # =============================================================
  # ABLATION: Core Novelty Only (DSC + MSRE)
  # =============================================================
  # NOTE: ContextEncoder MUST be enabled - it provides task signal!
  # Without it, the model has NO information about what transformation
  # to learn, causing inevitable background collapse.
  # 
  # The bottleneck concern (4.2M params -> 256-dim) is real but:
  # 1. The context vector conditions DSC's clue discovery
  # 2. Without context, DSC finds random clues
  # 3. Even a compressed signal is better than none

  # Temperature schedule for Gumbel-Softmax (DSC attention sharpness)
  # =================================================================
  # GOAL: See DSC contribute meaningfully within first 50 epochs
  # 
  # Temperature controls attention sharpness in Gumbel-Softmax:
  #   temp > 2.0: Nearly uniform attention (99% entropy) - DSC can't learn
  #   temp ~ 1.0: Moderately sharp - DSC starts learning
  #   temp < 0.5: Very sharp - risk of gradient issues
  #
  # Schedule analysis (exponential decay):
  #   tau_start=5.0: reaches 1.0 at epoch 206 (TOO SLOW)
  #   tau_start=2.0: reaches 1.0 at epoch 116 (STILL SLOW)
  #   tau_start=1.0: always below 1.0, sharp from start (FOR DEBUGGING)
  #
  # Using 1.0 for debugging - we need to see DSC working early!
